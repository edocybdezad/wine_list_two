# Wine List Two
 Same as [Wine-List-One](https://github.com/edocybdezad/Wine-List-One.git) but using Strapi CMS - deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) - to store content. Also render provides the web services

 This basic web page uses as UI base [Wine-List-UI](https://github.com/edocybdezad/Wine-List-UI.git).
 
Note: As a free account in Render is used for this project. In 90 days render
desactivates the database. PSQL db by the case.

About strapi I found is not that easy as I heard (maybe for some devs it is). it is better to start the project with a hosted PSQL. See acknowledgements part
